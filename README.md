# Preflop-frequency-analyzer (PFA)
PFA is a text parsing and visual analysis tool. Using the output from online poker games it charts the hand ranges that opponents are using in common preflop situations.

#Purpose
Understanding preflop ranges that you and your opponents are playing is the gateway to being a "thinking poker player." There doesn't seem to be many open source options for empirical analysis of preflop hand ranges. While tools like Equilab and Flopzilla offer great range v. range analysis tools at a low barrier of entry, they rely on users to input hand ranges. This is often done off of intuition and hundreds of hours of observation. PFA would offer empirical data on preflop hand ranges that are being played in a users games. This would allow the users to use range v. range analysis tools with more confidence and less poker experience.
